# PacMan
Project I did back in 2015 for the first course I did when I started Computer Engineering.
One day or another I'll revise it up properly because I lost the final version I submitted to the teacher, but this includes a working version, some embellishments I added on are missing by the way.

You need to install Python3 as well as Pygame
```
pip install pygame
```
